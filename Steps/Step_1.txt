tech description: 
we are going to use python fastapi framework for the server implementation and centrifugo web server 
for realtime events broadcasting, room creation etc.

This will run in a dockerized manner:

Can you setup the project with the bare basics from where we can start adding features and tests.
Just keep in mind, fast api server, and centrifugo for realtime connections.
Create folders and files such that i can continue bulding features easily.

A dummy dockerfile:

FROM python:3.12-slim

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /usr/src

# Install vim (or nano) to allow text editing in the container
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y vim

# Copy the requirements file
COPY requirements.txt ./

# Install dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the app code
COPY ./ ./

# Expose the port
EXPOSE 8000

# Start the application
CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:socket_app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000", "--reload"]


A dummy docker-compose

services:
  heisenberg-local-server:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    volumes:
      - .:/usr/src
    entrypoint: ["uvicorn"]
    command: ["app.main:server_app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000", "--reload"]
    container_name: "heisenberg"
