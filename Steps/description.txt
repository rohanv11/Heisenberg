What can a player do with the property?

Every property is capable of building 4 houses onto it.
Once you buy a property, anyone who lands on the property pays the rent of the property to the owner
You start with just buying the property with no houses built.
Then, there is condition for you to be applicable to build houses.
A player must own all the houses in one set, then he can start building houses.
Now there are two ways to build houses.
1st Even build
    You have to build houses evenly on all properties of the set.
2nd Random build.
    You can build all the houses at once on one property, and then go to the other property.
    So one property can have 1 house while other has 4 houses.

The above way is a Game config. It should be done using a config.
For eg, if even_build is chosen by user, we uses first way, else we use Random build.

What can a player do with stock market?

Player can use their cash to buy stocks, as a person would buy them in the real world.
Players can also list their properties on stock market along with other companies already in it.
